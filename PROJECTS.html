    <h1> Safety Device using GSM and GPS technology </h1>
    <h2>  DESCRIPTION: </h2> 
<p>    
Here, we are interfacing Arduino with GSM and GPS .This GSM and GPS helps in 
collecting information of current location of the user .
 Here we have used Arduino IDE and C language.A safety device utilizing GSM (Global System for Mobile 
 Communication) and GPS (Global Positioning System) technology represents a cutting-edge project aimed 
 at bolstering personal safety and security. This innovative device combines a range of hardware 
 components, including GPS and GSM modules, a microcontroller, and optional sensors like accelerometers
  or panic buttons. The GPS module provides precise location coordinates, while the GSM module 
  establishes a cellular connection for communication. The device operates under a microcontroller's
   control, enabling it to read GPS data, transmit SMS messages, and manage various sensors and power 
   sources </p>

<h1> Smart Agriculture Monitoring System</h1>
<h2> DESCRIPTION: </h2>
<p>

Here the objective   to design an effective water management system and to detect living obstacle such as human and animal 
and also to design a system which stores the monitored data into a database or cloud.The purpose of this project is to monitor the crop and control the amount of water being 
provided to the crop. Agriculture leads the worlds water consumption, accounting for up 
to 70%, and is also one of the major sectors that contributes to economic growth. One of 
the largest contributors to water wastage is low irrigation efficiency. It aims to tackle three 
main objectives: sustainably increasing agricultural productivity and incomes; adapting and 
building resilience to climate change; and reducing and/or removing greenhouse gas 
emissions, where possible.
Smart Agriculture can help farmers increase their productivity and help make profits. IoT 
Based Smart Agriculture is a technique that helps in the automation of irrigation, and 
monitoring of many parameters required by the crop, to grow.Despite technological advances in smart irrigation, traditional drip irrigation methods are 
still widely used as part of manual irrigation in agricultural fields. Traditional irrigation 
2
methods are inefficient and inaccurate, resulting in either too little or too much watering. 
Forecasting the right quantity at the right time is difficult. Furthermore, if farmers are not 
present in the field, they are unaware of animal or, in some cases, human invasions. The 
Internet of Things (IoT) is one technology that can be used in agriculture to counter this</p>
